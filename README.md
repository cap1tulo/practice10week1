1. What is a framework?

    A framework is a structured platform of tools, libraries, and conventions that provides a foundation for building software applications. It helps streamline development by offering reusable code and components, allowing developers to focus on custom logic rather than building everything from scratch.

2. Differences and Advantages of Frameworks

    Frameworks can vary based on language, functionality, or design principles. Common types include:
        Frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Vue): Specialize in building user interfaces.
        Backend frameworks (e.g., Django, Express): Focus on server-side functionality.
        Full-stack frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails): Handle both frontend and backend development.
    Advantages:
        Speed up development by providing ready-to-use code.
        Enforce best practices, leading to more maintainable code.
        Offer community support and resources.
        Ensure better security through standardized processes.

3. What kind of frameworks would you choose and why?

    The choice depends on the project requirements:
        For a frontend-heavy project, Iâ€™d consider React for its component-based architecture.
        For a full-stack web application, Django (Python) is useful due to its robust ORM and MVC pattern.
        For small projects or APIs, Express (Node.js) is lightweight and efficient.
